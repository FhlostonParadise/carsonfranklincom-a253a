      Social Media Newsfeeds fly by at a million miles per hour which make it
      great for witty commentary on the days events, and terrible for keeping
      track of the bigger picture.

      I like that there is a bit more room on the front page. I also like that
      the posts aren't the only focus on the page. I think it should have room
      to explain more about the site, than just ramming blog posts down your
      throat.
