      Ever since my first Geocities account (RIP), I've always had a special
      place in my heart for personal websites. Social Media has left far less
      room for them than ever, but I think as a tool for personal and
      professional narratives they are more important than ever. The Newsfeeds
      on Twitter and Facebook go flying by at lightspeed, and make it nearly
      impossible to organize and highlight the things you want to be front and
      center.

      I like that there is a bit more room on the front page. I also like that
      the posts aren't the only focus on the page. I think it should have room
      to explain more about the site, than just ramming blog posts down your
      throat.
