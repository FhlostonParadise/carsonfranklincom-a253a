      I'm a little happier with this idea moving ahead. I will take a bit more
      effort up front, and I hate to lose any work already done, but eh...  It
      is what it is.

      I like that there is a bit more room on the front page. I also like that
      the posts aren't the only focus on the page. I think it should have room
      to explain more about the site, than just ramming blog posts down your
      throat.
