## A Gen-X / Millenial Daywalker

I was born in 1979. Right smack in the no-man's land between 2 generations with very clear differences. I was born early enough to remember helping setup my elementary school's first computer lab (which consisted of a couple Apple II's), but late enough to understand that the current digital divide is not just based on class, but also age, What is 2nd nature and always available to me, needs to be a consideration when interacting with someone who may not have the same access or ability to understand certain technologies the way I do.

I think being in this gap is an advantage. I can comfortably wear either hat, and understand the view of someone who was born more in the middle of either generation.

I've seen the term Xennial and Jedi generation (born during the release of Star Wars: A New Hope and Star Wars: Return of the Jedi). I think either of those is just fine. I like the Daywalker (comic book reference to Blade, a half-human half-vampire who can walk around in the sunlight but has cool vampire powers) definition. I think it highlights the ability to blend in with either crowd without becoming absorbed by them.

# Professional

##### For my actual resume, it is located [here](https://carsonfranklin.com/professional). The following is more generalized, similar to a cover letter.

What I wrote about being a daywalker also holds true for my professional side. One on side, I've founded multiple companies and worked them through the seed stages of investment. I am comfortable with term sheets, due diligence packages, and capitalization tables. In regards to running the businesses I've been the CEO, President, Vice-President, CTO of 3 separate companies. I've always been a working manager, and prefer roles where I am able to balance management with implementation and design. I think losing sight of the technology is a problem when your job is to manage technologies as much as it is the staff that works with them. You'll find me right alongside my staff in the datacenter at 2am on a Saturday when something has failed. 

On the other side, I've had an active leadership role in the actual delivery of the services these companies provided. This includes the management and delivery of projects, becoming the SME in cloud based technologies and the vendors that offer them such as Microsoft Azure and Amazon Web Services. Early on I saw the value these potentially offered to clients and quickly pushed the companies to accreditation and partnerships with each. My Managed Service Provider business was one of the first to obtain a certification from Microsoft (Small and Midmarket Cloud Solutions Provider). I successfully moved dozens of our clients from Traditional Infrastructure to fully Cloud based Infrastructure while my competitors were still busy trying to sell clients server hardware and were convinced that Cloud technologies were insecure and inappropriate for use in SMB organizations.

In addition to being the SME in a lot of technologies I also oversaw all project based work for clients. I've been utilizing Project Management skills for 20 years now, but never actually sat down and achieved personal certification in project management (PMP) or IT service management (ITIL). My latest push is to now do both. I'm currently enrolled in Google's Project Management Certificate course while also studying for my PMP exam which I plan to have passed before mid-summer. Once that is done I'll knock some of the basic ITIL certifications. ITIL seems like a walk in the park as I've been using the methods in my day-to-day management of my MSP. The PMP also looks pretty simple with the exception of terms and the specific flow of projects within differing methodologies. They love their acronyms. I'm finding I enjoy the coursework and plan to pursue more in the future. CISSP would be a great addition, as would some Vendor specific ones from Amazon, Microsoft, and even Cisco (I attained a CCNA while in college but never re-activated it so it is loooong expired). Running the businesses had me more focused on the companies certifications and partnerships over my own personal ones. That was a mistake.
