## I Never Liked the Title "Generalist"

It sounds too similar to "generic". It also goes against the common misunderstanding that being a "specialist" in one certain area is preferable to being a generalist in many. That may be true for a database administrator or a React developer, but not for someone whose career revolves around advising clients on which technology may be best for them.

Being an advocate for one "stack" or one vendor's solution is the easiest way to becoming the hammer that sees every problem as just another nail. I do my best to avoid polarization in technology. This is always an unfortunate result for "specialists".

I think claims that "Linux is Best", "Apple is far superior to any Android device", and even the browser wars are counter-productive. I have my preferences just like anyone does, but what works best for me is certainly not guaranteed to be the best for you.

## The Gen-X / Millenial Daywalker

I was born in 1979. Right smack in the no-man's land between 2 generations with very clear differences. I was born early enough to remember helping setup my elementary school's first computer lab (which consisted of a couple Apple II's), but late enough to understand that the current digital divide is not just based on class, but also age, What is 2nd nature and always available to me, needs to be a consideration when interacting with someone who may not have the same access or ability to understand certain technologies the way I do.

I think being in this gap is an advantage. I can comfortably wear either hat, and understand the view of someone who was born more in the middle of either generation.

I've seen the term Xennial and Jedi generation (born during the release of Star Wars: A New Hope and Star Wars: Return of the Jedi). I think either of those is just fine. I like the Daywalker (comic book reference to Blade, a half-human half-vampire who can walk around in the sunlight but has cool vampire powers) definition. I think it highlights the ability to blend in with either crowd without becoming absorbed by them.
