### You're unaware how useful it is until you have one.

At first it might seem like a novelty. Something that you might use every once in a while, but not all that important. I guess that could be said about a lot of things, like the Kitchen Aid mixer under the counter, the ridiculous juicer that takes an hour to clean every time you use it, or the photo scanner you bought with the intention of scanning every photo you have, but haven't opened the box.

This turned out to be one that I use a lot. For far more than I actually believed I would. It hasn't been without it's own challenges. For one, it takes a skill that only a few already have. If you want to use designs that others have already created and made available on sites like Thingiverse, and that's it, then you'll be quite limited and it may not be as useful for you. In addition to learning how to assemble, operate, and the maintain the printer, I found that to really get use out of it, I had to learn how to design objects I needed it to print. Most of these were not readily available, so that made the skills needed to be successful with it exponentially more involved.

Thankfully there are countless tutorials on YouTube dedicated to learning CAD design. Anyone with a basic understanding of graphic design shouldn't be too lost. In college I took my fair share of courses on digital design that used tools like Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator. The basics of designing 3D objects was close enough that I got up and running pretty quick.

This post will probably become the intro to a ton of other sub-posts on the topic. For now, it's sort of a placeholder while I sort that out.
