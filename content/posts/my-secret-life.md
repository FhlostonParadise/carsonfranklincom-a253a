  My neighbors would probably disagree with my description of "secret". At
  times, I'm sure the whole block is well aware.

### In A Parallel Universe Or Alternate Reality....

Somewhere, there exists a version of myself that pushed through his trepidation, and found just enough luck to make music his life's work. Sometimes I think I envy that person, other times I believe he envies me. Had I found even marginal success, I'd probably find myself trapped by my own, and by other's expectations.

### The Lost Joel Zimmerman Orchestral Compositions

A few years ago, I heard a guy named Joel Zimmerman talk about this. He really wanted to explore releasing an album of music he composed that would be recorded and performed by a traditional musical orchestra. While I'm sure nothing could actually prevent him from doing so, he still felt the potential negative response was enough to dissuade him from trying (for now). Joel has since found enough success that I'm sure he could retain the world's top classical orchestra for several years to do nothing else than work with him.

### The Berlin Orchestra's Most Important Performance "The Drop"

Joel does most of his work under the name "Deadmau5" which I should have probably mentioned earlier. His description of the 17 year old fans frantically trying to find the 'drop' in his fictional classical release was pretty spot on and hilarious. His work as a web developer prior to the rise of Deadmau5 still give me hope.

*I'd still like a chance to learn more about classical composition and orchestral arrangements. Riding a wave of fame and fortune like mau5 would also be pretty fun too, I reckon.*
