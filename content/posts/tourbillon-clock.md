## A Challenge... To Say The Least.

*Thanks to @mechanista at My Mini Factory for the design. I stuck with most of his parts, but made some changes to quite a few to better accommodate the final goal I had in mind.*

**

Over the course of about 100 hours of printing, and another 80 hours of redesign and assembly I produced the clock you see above. It is 100% fully 3D printed, with the exception of some metal pins and small bolts inserted in the base to hold gears and assemblies. There are no electronics or batteries (yet) to drive the mechanism and it relies solely on tension from a 3D printed spring that is manually wound. I plan to add a small stepper motor to keep tension and maintain accuracy at some point.

Here is a video of the clock in action. The first is a normal speed version that focuses on the Tourbillon movement, with the 2nd having slowed the speed to show the movement a little more clearly.
