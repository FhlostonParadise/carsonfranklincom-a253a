## Some Background

As I started adding bits of technology to my home network I started to realize it was looking more and more like a network I might encounter at a client's office. I decided that if that was the case, I should document it in the same way. I'm glad I did. I've completely rebuilt it quite a few times, and having the documentation on each service with notes on why things were setup a certain way saved me a lot of time. Here is the latest iteration of it with some specific details redacted.
