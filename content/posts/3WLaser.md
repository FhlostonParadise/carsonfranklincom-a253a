Over the course of the 2020-2021 Pandemic I found myself with some extra time. Like many others, I took the opportunity to do some DIY projects. One of these (unlike many others) was a 3 Watt RGB Laser Projector system I built from (essentially) scratch. This post will be the narrative and thought process I put into it's design, build, and the lessons learned along the way.

> It is critically important that anyone working around or near lasers that operate above 5 milliwatts of output power know the risks associated with these devices. 

I cannot emphasize enough how dangerous these lasers can be. They have enough power to cause permanent and irreversible damage to your eyes in less time than it takes to blink.
